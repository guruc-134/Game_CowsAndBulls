# game play
this is a two player game 
one player chooses a number and says the number of digits in his number
lets say:
number= 1254 (is not revealed)
digits =4 (is revealed)
the second player starts guessing the number 

first try\
first player: number is 3424?\
second player : 1 cow 1 bull!\
here cow represent the digit which is correctly guessed but its present in a different place \
2 here\
bull represents a digit which is correctly guessed along with the position \
4 here\

in this way when the first player goes on guessing until he gets 
4 (digits) number of bulls then his number of steps to guess the answer correctly are noted 

now the first person chooses a number which the second person tries to guess
who ever finishes the game with least number of steps wins
